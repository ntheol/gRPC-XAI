    Calculate the partial dependence for a single dimension.

    regular intervals between its bounds.

    when the influence of all other dimensions are averaged out.

    Parameters
    ----------
    space : `Space`
        The parameter space over which the minimization was performed.

    model
        Surrogate model for the objective function.

    i : int
        The dimension for which to calculate the partial dependence.

    samples : np.array, shape=(n_points, n_dims)
        Randomly sampled and transformed points to use when averaging
        the model function at each of the `n_points` when using partial
        dependence.

    n_points : int, default=40
        Number of points at which to evaluate the partial dependence

    Returns
    -------
    xi : np.array
        The points at which the partial dependence was evaluated.

        The average value of the modelled objective function at
        each point `xi`.
